# slack-christmas-status

## Description

The slack-christmas-status app is designed to capture the magic and excitement of counting down to Christmas Day. As someone who absolutely loves the holiday season, I found myself eagerly updating a daily countdown status to share my anticipation. To simplify the process and spread the Christmas cheer more efficiently, this app automates the countdown using GitHub Actions and the Slack API.

### Motivation
Christmas has always held a special place in my heart, and part of the joy it brings me is the act of counting down the days until the festivities begin. This anticipation is something I wanted to share consistently with others.

### Why This Project Exists
Manually updating the countdown each day turned out to be cumbersome and prone to forgetfulness. That's when the idea clicked: why not automate this routine task? By using GitHub Actions and the Slack API, this app takes care of the countdown for me, ensuring that the message is always up-to-date and shared with my circle.

### Problem Solved
This Christmas Countdown App eradicates the need for daily manual updates. Not only does it save me time and effort, but it also ensures that my countdown proclamation is timely and accurate. This way, I can focus more on enjoying the holiday season and less on the logistics of keeping my countdown current.
